SDLC
  ===============================
=> Requirements Gathering

=> collect the data
-  from customers
-  from end user
-  from market

=> feasibility study - to analyze all information gathered

=> document
- SRS

- requirements should have some criteria

=> SMART

- Specific
 it should clearly say, what is wanted from the functionality / software

- Measurable
 the requirement should be measurable specifically for technical things like functionality being responsive

- Attainable
in software we can not make to smell the food, but we can have pictures of the food

- Realistic
it should be realistic from business mind set

- Testable
  for functionality / software to be shipped to the users, needs to be testable, if can not test we can not say that we developed what is wanted from us

Design
=======================================
- architecture of the application
- micro service development
- what kind of API (RestAPI)
- what kind of development framework will be used
- data base
- ui / ux
- together with development framework, testing framework is also designed in this step

=> who will be involved
  - project manager
  - product owner - now he will build the communication to the technical team
  - business analyst - will translate requirements to be understandable for technical people - developers and testers
